# Limitations:
#   This container runs plakar without a shared host cache.
#   Each invocation starts with a cold cache (no VFS cache, no cached
#   daemon persistence).  For improved incremental performance, mount a
#   persistent volume at the plakar cache directory, e.g.:
#       docker run -v plakar-cache:/home/plakar/.cache/plakar ...
#
